# Passage

[v i e w  &nbsp;&nbsp;  h e r e](http://wdi-passage.herokuapp.com)

## Why

Travelling off the beaten path often requires trawling through scores of reviews on online forums and blog posts to find routes. When tasked to build a CRUD app as our second project, I built Passage to solve this by allowing users to share and up-vote user submitted routes.

## What I Learned

For this second project, I learned a lot about building CRUD apps, [entity relationship mapping] (https://goo.gl/p90N9P), using AWS and CarrierWave.

## Where This Could Go

I would like to add user profiles, downvoting features, a web text editor, improved site navigation and improved search functionality.
